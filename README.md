## Usage

>Tha API and the MySQL Database are connected and both of them are deployed on AWS. Requests are handeled online for the React Native Webshop homework application.

## Challenges
> The time constraint made it really hard to do an exhaustive test phase. To write both the back-end and front-end, switching the mindset was rather challenging and exhausting, and deploying it on AWS made the project even more complex.
